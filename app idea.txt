I am the shopkeeper of a supermarket. Our merchandise sales have fallen due to the current
COVID-19 situation, because more and more consumers prefer to order online to keep social distance.

I need an application that I and my customers can run on our phone. Here are some requirements:

I want my customers to be able to see the list of products that are updated asynchronously,
including availability and product information.

I want my customers to be able to preview product images and overviews through this app, and
increase/decrease the number of products they want to add to the cart with simple +/- buttons.

I want my customers to be able to re-edit the number of items on the shopping cart page.

I want my customers to be able to place their order on the cart page and choose the
delivery time and address.

I want to have a separate customer account information page in this application so that 
customers can change personal information such as adding/removing addresses and phone numbers

I want the app to send customer orders to my mailbox so that I can process them in time.

I want the application to summarize the sales volume of each product to me every day so that 
I can analyze the profit and purchase.
